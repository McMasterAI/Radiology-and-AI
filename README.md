Summary of ML models

The intended tasks include:
- Automatic segmentation of brain metastasis/tumors and edema (swelling) 
- Prediction of tumor type (multiclass classification)
- Prediction of immunotherapy response (binary classification)
- Prediction of tumor pseudoprogression vs true tumor progression

The intended models to do these tasks include deep convolutional neural network based architectures, including deep residual networks. Transfer learning will be used. It is expected that this large dataset will result in superior performance compared to previous similar work. 
## Project Background
9-50% of patients with malignant tumours develop brain metastasis, and 30% of these patients do so before the primary cancer is known. For these patients it is essential to identify quickly and accurately the primary tumour for the staging and treatment planning. Current methods for do so are lacking, and previous work has demonstrated that Articifial Intelligence models show strong ability in differentiating between tumour types. Artificial Intelligence can take into account features of tumours not perceptible to the human eye and which current diagnostic techniques do not take into account, thus showing the technologies potential for providing radiologists and clinicians with the ability to more accurately predict the primary tumor in patients with brain metastasis. 

Recent studies have also shown Artificial Intelligence has the potential not only to determine primary tumour types, but also predict tumour response to radiotherapy. Identification of patients who would be most likely to benefit from costly and difficult treatments like immunotherapy would also be of great benefit to patients an radiologists alike. 

Additionally, patients diagnosed with glioblastomas often face challenges in treatment due to changes in the imaging of the tumour showing ambiguous pictures of progression of the cancer versus improvement. A tool which can differentiate which patients are undergoing tumour progression versus so called "pseudoprogression" could be highly benficial in treatment of glioblastoma.
